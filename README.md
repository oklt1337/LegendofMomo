# Legend of Momo
Legend of Momo is a mini RPG with inspiration from The Legend of Zelda.
In LoM you have to explore a small world in which several enemies are waiting for you, which you have to defeat in order to defeat the final boss at the end.
I programmed LoM in the first semester of my studies. In this project I learned the basics of game development and one of the main features of the game is that it consists of a lot of ScriptableObjects
